The code for all the experiments can be found here. The code needs cleaning. 

DFT_be.ipybnb has the code to generate the potential as well as all the figures in our paper. The notebook also contains the definition of Li and Ne wave-functions so the other potentials can be generated easily from the notebook by just changing the wave-functions.
